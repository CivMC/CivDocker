        - "       &5AVOID DOING\n     THE FOLLOWING\n     IF YOU WANT TO\n         SURVIVE\n\n&r1. Breaking people's stuff\n2. Jumping into obsidian pits\n3. Crossing into excluded areas\n4. Anything people would kill you for."
        - "  &5THEY WILL KILL YOU&r\nLeave the raiding until you understand how to get away with it.\nCameras are watching!\n\nLoot stolen without care is easily taken away, and damages your reputation with others!\nOr will find you killed and banished to the nether"
        - "It is always important to remember this:\n\nOn CivMC your actions have consequences.\n\nYou have 1 account. 1 name. Don't dirty it the first chance you get.\n\nThat is if you want to make something of yourself.\nWhatever that may be."
        - "            &5TOS&r\nCivMC is not complete anarchy. You can and will be banned if you break the server rules.\n (Find on the discord)\n\nRefrain from using hacks or spouting slurs.\nAct like a decent human being and all will be well."
