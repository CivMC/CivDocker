      title: Welcome ${player}!
      author: RedDevel
      pages: 
        - "&5Hello and welcome to CivMC, &2${player}!\n\n   A server based on nation building and political roleplay, where admin control is minimal and players have the opportunity to dispense their own justice. A world ripe with chance for any new friend to carve out their own legacy."
        - "With an almost decade long history, filled with moments of high excitement in war and of peace, farming and socializing with your closest allies. Where countries, towns, and cities consist of more than just the blocks they're made of." 
        - "   &1Namelayer&r\nPocket radios! Create or join chat groups to communicate with friends all over CivMC. By default you have joined global chat or ! chat. You can switch from local chat (1000 block radius) to this one by performing the command: /g !"
        - "Go back to localchat by performing the /g command on it own. This works for any group you are allowed to speak in. just switch ! for the name of the group. \nCreate your own group using the GUI by perfoming the /nl Command."
        - "   &1Citadel&r\nAnother use for your groups! Slow down raiders by reinforcing blocks such as your house or your chests and doors to lock them. Reinforced blocks take multiple breaks to drop for players not on the reinforcement group."
        - "To reinforce a block perform the command /ctr <Groupname> while holding stone, iron or diamond. Then punch any block to reinforce it to that group. Now only you and your allies can interact with that block! Tip: Use /ctf instead to reinforce while building!"
        - "   &1Hiddenore&r\nSuddenly iron surrounds you! Ores spawn around you as you mine. While caves are still dusted with some visible ores, the main way to get ores is to dig. Ores still hold the same height level for their rarity."
        - "Diamonds are unique on civmc. They spawn in what is called a vein. Veins consist of single diamond ores, spaced out over a wide area (as much as 11 blocks from other ores) and can be quite profitable. A message will appear in chat whenever a diamond ore is uncovered" 
        - "It is recommended to mark diamond ores with a block or a waypoint to get an idea of the size of the vein. \nUse silk touch on all ores for increased returns when smelting them in the Ore smelter factory. (better than fortune!)"
        - "   &1JukeAlert&r\nSmile! you're on snitches! Jukeboxes and note blocks when reinforced will turn into a snitch and notify players on the group when other players enter its 23x23 box field. Note blocks turned snitch only hold this one function." 
        - "Jukeboxes in addition also log some actions, like block breaks or the opening of doors and chests. You can access a jukebox and its logs if you're on its group by performing the /ja command. To name a nearby snitch perform the /janame (Snitchname)"
        - "   &1ExilePearl&r\nKilling other players with an ender pearl in your hotbar will banish them to the nether. A filled Pearl require essence to keep the player trapped. The location of the pearl is shown to the pearled player and can be broadcast to others. So watch your back..."
        - "   &1Essence&r\nYou get essence every day for logging in. This is used to maintain an ExilePearl and is very valuable to some players and nations. Selling your essence can be a good way to get some starting resources. If you don't plan on using it."
        - "   &1FactoryMod&r\nThe industrial revolution in cube form! Factories produce items at quicker and better rates. Or produce items otherwise unavailable or locked away such as XP or netherite. Costs might be high for some however, working together is advised!"
        - "Perform the command /Fm to see all factories available, as well as their creation costs and recipes. Make your own factory by putting down a chest next to a crafting table next to a furnace. Input the costs for making a factory in the chests, and hit the furnace with a stick"
        - "   &1RealisticBiomes&r\nHermit's bane! Biomes each have their own growable crops and trees, forcing players to trade, travel or expand their nations borders to gain access to all the crops they need. XP is made with a variety of these crops in the crucible factory."
