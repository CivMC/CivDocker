#  proxy - threshold: value in the database above which an IP Data record is considered a proxy source
#  proxy - banMessage: if proxy bans enabled, the message to use
#  share - threshold: How many accounts in addition to a player's main account are they allowed to connect with? 0 for no alts, 1 for one alt, etc.
#  share - banMessage: if share bans enabled, the message to use
#  enable:
#   - ipBans: If banstick should autoban players for existing, standing IP bans.
#   - subnetBans: If banstick should autoban players for existing, standing bans on subnets containing the connecting IP
#   - proxyKicks: If banstick should autokick players for existing, standing banable proxies (does not issue ban)
#   - proxyBans: If banstick should autoban players for existing, standing bans of known proxies (enable proxyKicks to also kick)
#   - newProxyBans: If banstick should check the proxy threshold and create new bans for proxies if non already exists (leave true even if only kicking)
#   - transitiveBans: If banstick should apply bans transitive across IPs
#   Usage notes: To ban AND kick on new proxy detection, turn on proxyKicks, proxyBans, and newProxyBans.
#                To ban but not kick, turn on proxyBans, and newProxyBans.
#                To kick but not ban, turn on proxyKicks and newProxyBans.
#                To only leverage existing proxy bans (direct import?) use either proxyKicks or proxyBans but leave newProxyBans off.
#  
#   - shareBans: If banstick should enforce the share threshold with bans.
#   Usage notes: Set share.threshold to > 0 to allow some multiaccounting. If exceeded, will ban only the newest.
